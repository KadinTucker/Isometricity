# Isometricity
A project to test out isometric display for rectangular grids of tiles and learn java swing graphics.

Isometricity generally refers to having the same dimensions, but in this case refers to the projection of 3d space onto a 2d surface. This project aims to project a 2d surface at an angle so that it appears at a more appealing vantage point to the observer and is able to show objects standing upright.
